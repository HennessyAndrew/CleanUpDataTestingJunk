#I used https://rpubs.com/ninjazzle/DS-JHU-3-4-Final a lot
#install library(dplyr) #library(tidyverse)
#set directory setwd("C:/Users/Charlotte/Census/Coursera/NewNumber4")
#download ZIP and unpack filename <- "Coursera_DS3_Final.zip"

#Load the unzipped files

# load features.txt. It is a list of all features 
# col.names names columns in the table = "n" and "functons"
#load activity_labels. These are the activities performed
# col.names names columns = "code" & "activity
activities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("code", "activity"))

LOad all TEST FILES with same column names
Also use features$functions above

Join the two files.
#Adds column names via the contents of features using the functions column features$functions
#Merge x_train & x_test data sets using the columns from features$functions
#Merge y_train & y_test data sets using the column = Code
#Merge subject_train & subject_test data sets using. They both use the column = Subject
#Merge Subject, X, & Y datasets

# USe select on Merged_Data We want to get measurements on the mean and standard deviation from Merged_Data.
#Updated joined column names


#create new data set from TidyData with mean for activties
